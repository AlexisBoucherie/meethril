# meethril

Meethril is a 15h solo challenge realized during my studentship at WilsCodeSchool, Bordeaux.

We were given carte blanche for the topic we'd work on, as long as we realized our app with Symfony.

As a tapletop role player and a long-time Dungeon Master (aka DM), I know how it can be for someone to find a group of people to play with. So I had the idea to build a plaform on which the users can organize game sessions.

There are two main possibilities for a user:
- As a DM, I can create a new session, manage its details (where, when...) and accept new players.
- As a player, I can go through the list of all available sessions, look at their details and ask to join one.

* As you read this, this is still a WIP that I hope to finish as soon as I can.
